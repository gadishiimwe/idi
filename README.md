# 1 John 4:20
**If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.**
# Luke 6:22
**Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man!**

# VACATION ROUTINE
**Absorb Morning Sun**
**Sleep 8hrs+ daily**
**Stretch Exercises ..**
*No your dress never effect your growth. Our bodies stretch about 1/2 inch every night while we sleep, and during the day you shrink back down 1/2 inch. Why? Because of “gravity” pulling down all day and smushing your body. Astronauts actually grow up to 2 inches when they float in space. While sleeping and living in Space station the cartilages expands in our spine.*
